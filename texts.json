Luckily I don\u2019t have to guess, because that person was me. I \nmade that statement in response to the first rounds of LLMs (GPT3, 3.5, PALM2 etc). It remained a firm \nconviction of mine through the release of GPT-4o and Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude models. \nBoth proved incredible at resolving problems, but only if they were presented with all the facts, and \nsubsequently, guided through the steps.

We were \u201cpatching\u201d the reasoning process with hacks, such as \nprompt engineering, RAG systems, multi-agent conversations, chain-of-thought prompting, and so on. \nAt Tricentis, our team is working day to day implementing LLMs to solve complex multi-step problems, \nso we were at the coalface, seeing just how unreliable these solutions became in practice. Frustrating \ndays passed, as we tried to figure out \u201cWhy wont the AI do the obvious next step!?\u201d Or, as we ad", "nt the AI do the obvious next step!?\u201d Or, as we added \nmore and more complex prompts, to shoehorn predictability at the cost of generalized usefulness. At \nevery turn, the conviction that AI couldn\u2019t reason became more concrete in my mind. \n \nUntil now. So what changed? \nOn Jan. 20, the Chinese AI company DeepSeek released a language model called R1 that, according to the \ncompany, outperforms industry leading models like OpenAI o1 on several benchmarks. These two models \nfit into a new class: M", "chmarks. These two models \nfit into a new class: Models designed, and trained, to reason. Let\u2019s dive into why that matters, and why \nDeepSeek R1 specifically has sent shockwaves through the AI industry. \n \nTraditional LLMs can\u2019t reason \nThe way traditional language models (strange as it may sound to say that about a technology all of 8 \nminutes old) are trained is generally in two ways: \n1. Fill in the blank \nA common training method involves masking words in a sentence and having the model pred", "king words in a sentence and having the model predict what \nthose words should be. This is a form of unsupervised training, since no human intervention is needed, \nand is the baseline of all LLMs. By showing them massive amounts of text, where certain words are \nobscured, they learn to predict what words fill that gap based on the surrounding text. It\u2019s a massive \noversimplification, hiding the complexity of attention heads and tokens, but essentially this allows them \nto learn the manifold mean", "ially this allows them \nto learn the manifold meaning of language, in context, not just the dictionary definitions. \n2. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) \nHuman reinforcement, or RLHF, is a supervised technique, often used for fine-tuning after the initial \ntraining. These teach the AI to get better at giving the \u201ctype of responses humans expect.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a \nvague phrase, but we are vague beings. Here, we tune the LLM to answer questions, respond to \nconversation, and offer f", "r questions, respond to \nconversation, and offer feedback that improves subsequent responses. We basically teach it to be a \nchatbot, and as a by-product it learns to approximate solutions to some problems, and to deliver them \nin language that its trainers have deemed socially acceptable. \nThis is not how we solve complex problems \nThink about how you would solve a complex problem. This could be anything from designing an \napplication feature, to writing this blog post. You plan, you build, you", "o writing this blog post. You plan, you build, you iterate, you correct, you conclude. \nIt is a multi-step process, involving continual reflection: Am I doing this right? Is this the right track? Do I \nneed to adjust? \nThis is where traditional LLMs fail. They are trained to give the answer in one quick shot. \n \nThinking fast and slow \nIn his book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow,\u201d Daniel Kahneman proposes two models for how we think: \n \nThese map really well to the patterns of language models. All the ", " well to the patterns of language models. All the models released prior to OpenAI\u2019s o1 \nmodel were essentially System 1 models. They responded fast, matched patterns, and did their best \nbased on what you gave them. \nAgain, what changed? \n \nOpenAI o1 and the introduction of System 2 (reasoning) models \nOpenAI is not Open AI \nWhen OpenAI launched o1 in September of 2024, they titled the post \u201cLearning to reason with LLMs.\u201d \nThe results in benchmarks were pretty impressive, especially in complex t", "ks were pretty impressive, especially in complex tasks: \nSource: OpenAI blog post \n \nI found it particularly fascinating that it showed no improvement in AP English, demonstrating once and \nfor all to my high school English teacher that English is irrational. \nBut OpenAI only published the what.

Claims of massive compute resources needed, cups of water vanishing \nfor every request, and power req", " water vanishing \nfor every request, and power requirements needing entire nations to redo their energy grids fed the \nVenture Capital machine to push more and more money into these heavily funded, transparent-as-mud \nAI enterprises, seeing the promise of human-level reasoning models finally coming to fruition. \nEvidence of System 2 \u201cthinking:\u201d The shift to test-time compute \nO1 was the first model to shift the way models responded to questions. Instead of immediately launching \ninto the answer,", "Instead of immediately launching \ninto the answer, like a nervous intern at a job interview, they began to think first by design. When \nanswering a question, the model will immediately begin an internal monologue, planning out its actions. \nWhen OpenAI launched o1, they called this \u201cthe hidden chain of thought,\u201d and like everything else \nOpenAI does, the techniques were hidden along with it.

Reports of it collecting keystrokes, prompt, audio, and video data and open up legitimate concerns \nabout how that data is used, for what purpose, and by whom. I am not about to wade into the murky \nland of geopolitics, but suffice it to say that you should talk to your organization\u2019s legal counsel and data \nprivacy team before you even send your first prompt. For reference, this is the reaction that mine gave: \n \n \nBut what about o3? \nThis is true; the DeepSeek models a", "hat about o3? \nThis is true; the DeepSeek models are not as good as the o3 models, but I am convinced that they will be. \nI am convinced of it because the template that they provided for how these models are trained gives a \nlow-cost path towards incrementally improving, specializing and deploying these models for tasks such \nas coding, math, and science. We will see the next version of DeepSeek within months, and the open \nresearch alternatives and improvements are already popping up. \nThe moat", "and improvements are already popping up. \nThe moat built around OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models has been bridged, and the game is afoot. \nWhat does this mean for QA and DevOps? \nThese are planning tasks \nCurrent models are doing alright at dev and QA tasks. They are proving good at generating code, or \nproposing tests, but they have a shortcoming. They perform poorly when the task requires thinking one \nor two layers deeper. For coding, this might be considering design principles or planning out an AP", "onsidering design principles or planning out an API library \nbefore implementing. For QA, this takes the form of applying testing strategies, considering techniques \nsuch as boundaries, security loopholes, confounding variables, and combinations of inputs that could \nprovoke defective behavior. \nO1 models are good, but most of the data is confidential \nAt Tricentis, we have seen a strong reticence in our customers towards fully adopting cloud-based, \nopaque models. They may trust us, but we are ", "ed, \nopaque models. They may trust us, but we are asking them to also relay that trust on to a third party \n(OpenAI). This is a bridge too far for many data-savvy enterprises or groups that have heavy regulatory \nor privacy burdens. \nDeepSeek opens the door to custom, private, edge AI \nDeepSeek provides the ideal blend of performance (being a competent reasoning model), adaptability \n(through fine tuning, with models like DeepSeek Coder already popping up), and Deployability.

I see this \nbeing a game changer for the highly sensitive world of development and QA. \nClosing thoughts \nIf you made it this far by reading the whole article, thank you. If you skipped to the end to get the \nconclusions, here they are: \n1. DeepSeek is a game changer for the open source community, providing bleeding edge performance \nwithout the opacity of API deployed models \n2. Reasoning models are the next phase of AI development, and thanks to this open researc", "of AI development, and thanks to this open research will accelerate \nfaster than I had thought possible \n3. AI that can think is here, and the types of tasks it can do are fairly unbounded \n4.
